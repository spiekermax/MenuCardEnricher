# Menu card enricher

This native Android app uses text recognition to automatically detect any dishes on a menu.
Detected dishes are enriched with images from Bing and additional useful information found on Wikipedia.
Furthermore it allows you to scan multiple pages, manage your order and read out your order with correct
pronounciation in the native language using text to speach.
